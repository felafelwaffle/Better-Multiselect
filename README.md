# Better-Multiselect

This javascript library aims to correct the usability blunder that is the standard HTML multi-select.
No human should have to hold down the control or command key to select multiple things on a web form.
This library replaces all HTML multiselects on the page with rich DHTML versions (scrollable lists of checkboxes).
An optional toolbar can be added that shows the number of items selected and provides links to select or deselect
all items.  This library is coded with straight javascript and thus has no dependencies, other than the embedded
EventCache library (Copyright Mark Wubben).
